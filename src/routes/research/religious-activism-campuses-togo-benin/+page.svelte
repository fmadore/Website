		This project uncovers the neglected history of Christian and Muslim student associations
		at the Université de Lomé (Togo) and the Université d'Abomey-Calavi (Benin), and examines
		their resilience and adaptability over five decades. While much of the literature has
		focused on the role of student protests in triggering national conferences in Benin and
		Togo in the early 1990s, this study broadens the lens to include the significant but often
		overlooked religious dimension of campus life.
	</p>

	<p>
		Drawing on interviews with several generations of activists and press coverage from both
		countries, the research analyses the emergence and evolution of these religious
		associations under challenging political circumstances: a one-party dictatorship in Togo
		and a Marxist-Leninist regime in Benin. It explores how these groups navigated
		authoritarian rule, political liberalisation and the principles of laïcité, while shaping
		campus dynamics in institutions originally known as strongholds of leftist,
		anti-imperialist and secular ideologies.
	</p>

	<p>
		The study reveals the university campus as a microcosm reflecting broader national
		socio-political trends, while also highlighting the importance of translocal factors in
		shaping the internal dynamics of these groups. Amidst the massification of university
		enrolments and rising graduate unemployment in recent decades, faith-based associations
		have expanded their role beyond religious guidance. Increasingly, they offer a "social
		curriculum", providing a space for socialisation and a set of skills, norms and moral
		values that complement the secular academic curriculum.
	</p>

	<p>
		By analysing the interplay between religion, politics and education, this book provides
		new insights into the evolving role of faith in public universities and broader societal
		transformations in West Africa. It explores the implications of growing religiosity for
		these public universities as secular institutions, and contributes to our understanding of
		how religious organisations have coexisted with, and sometimes challenged, traditional
		student associations since the 1970s.
