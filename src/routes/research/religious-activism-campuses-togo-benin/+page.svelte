        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Project Overview</h2>
        <p>My book <em>Religious Activism on Campuses in Togo and Benin</em> examines how Christian and Muslim student associations transformed university life at the Université de Lomé and the Université d'Abomey-Calavi. Drawing on extensive archival research and interviews with several generations of activists, I show how these faith-based organisations emerged in the 1970s within institutions dominated by leftist and secular ideologies, and ultimately reshaped campus culture by offering students both spiritual guidance and practical support.</p>
        
        <p>This research project analyzes the transformation of university life through the lens of religious student organizations. I trace the evolution of these groups from their origins in the 1970s through periods of political upheaval and democratization in the 1990s, to their contemporary manifestations.</p>
