		Muslims in Benin and Togo rarely make international headlines, except when warnings are
		issued about jihadist groups from the Sahel region encroaching on the Gulf of Guinea.
		This project moves beyond such narrow security concerns to examine the everyday lives of
		Muslim minorities in Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and Lomé. Using a combination of archival
		research and long-term ethnography, it traces the trajectories of these communities from
		the 1960s to the present day. It explores how living as an internally diverse minority
		within a Christian-majority environment shapes religious practice, civic engagement and
		claims to citizenship.

		A key finding of this project is that political elites often exploit global terror
		narratives to neutralise domestic dissent. In Togo, for example, the Faure Gnassingbé
		regime responded to the anti-government protests of 2017–2018 by pitting state-loyal
		"good Muslims" against perceived opposition-aligned "bad Muslims". By branding the
		opposition leader Tikpi Atchadam and his party as "Salafi" radicals, the state exploited
		Western fears of jihadism to discredit calls for democratic reform <ItemReference

		/>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In neighbouring Benin, Imam Ibrahim Ousmane's controversial election to the National Assembly in 2019 exposed divisions within the Muslim community regarding legitimate representation in a minority context <ItemReference

		/>. In both cases, accusations of "radicalisation" are employed as rhetorical weapons in
		disputes over local leadership and resources, rather than reflecting imported ideologies <ItemReference

		/>.
	</p>

		Beyond politics, the project examined the statistical narratives that shape religious
		life in these countries. While official census data suggests a clear shift from "African
		traditional religions" to monotheism, a critical analysis of religious categorisation
		reveals a more complex reality. In Benin, for example, Muslim and Christian
		identities rarely exist in isolation; they often overlap with long-standing Vodun
		practices <ItemReference
			id="repenser-categorisation-religieuse-benin-2026"
		/>. By transcending rigid theological boundaries, this research shows that minority
		status is not just a demographic limitation, but a dynamic space in which believers
		navigate faith, power and belonging in one of the most religiously diverse areas of West
		Africa.
