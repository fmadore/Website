		This research project (2026-2027), co-directed with <a
			href="https://www.zmo.de/en/people/dr-aksana-ismailbekova"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">Aksana Ismailbekova</a
		>, uses artificial intelligence (AI) to unlock valuable historical collections about
		Islamic communities in West Africa and Central Asia. These archives contain thousands of
		documents in multiple languages (including Russian, Arabic, Hausa, and Tajik) that have
		remained largely inaccessible due to their volume and complexity.
	</p>

	<p>
		The project focuses on two often-overlooked regions: West Africa (post-1960s) and
		Central Asia (colonial/early Soviet era and documents from the Tajik civil war,
		1992-97). By comparing these regions, we explore how Islamic discourse and responses
		to modernity developed in different contexts.
	</p>

	<h2>AI-Driven Comparative History</h2>
	<p>Using AI technologies, we aim to:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Develop systems</strong> that recognize multilingual text and identify key information
			across diverse scripts and layouts.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Create a chatbot</strong> that answers complex questions using documents across
			languages, enabling researchers to ask natural language questions like "How were notions
			of 'reform' debated differently in these contexts?"
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Ensure accessibility</strong> by prioritizing open-source, low-resource AI models,
			promoting equitable research practices that don't rely on high-resource institutional
			walls.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		This approach will reveal previously hidden connections and demonstrate how diverse
		Islamic communities navigated major historical transitions. All findings and tools will
		be made freely available, benefiting researchers worldwide, especially in West Africa
		and Central Asia.
	</p>

	<h2>Unlocking "Peripheral" Archives</h2>
	<p>
		Our work focuses on two unique, multilingual archives housed at <a
			href="https://www.zmo.de/en"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">Leibniz-Zentrum Moderner Orient (ZMO)</a
		>:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The <a href="https://islam.zmo.de/s/westafrica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
				><em>Islam West Africa Collection</em></a
			>: Covering post-1960s Islamic discourse and public engagement.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <a
				href="https://www.zmo.de/en/library/special-collection-1/translate-to-english-reinhard-eisener-bestand"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Reinhard Eisener Collection</em></a
			>: Documenting colonial and early Soviet governance in Central Asia, including materials
			from the Tajik civil war.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		By combining expertise in regional studies, history, and AI, this project will uncover
		important historical insights while creating new methods for studying complex archives
		globally.
