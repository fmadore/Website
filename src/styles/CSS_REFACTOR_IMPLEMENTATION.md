- **PostCSS Focus-Visible Plugin Conflict** (Sept 28, 2025) - Disabled `focus-visible-pseudo-class` feature in postcss-preset-env due to parsing conflicts causing "unclosed comment" errors during build

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking changes | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout |
| Team adoption | Low | Medium | Training sessions, documentation |
