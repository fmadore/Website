    years: "2023",
    shortDescription: "Inspired by the WikiCite initiative, which aims \"to develop open citations and linked bibliographic data to serve free knowledge\", the metadata of all the bibliographical references of the Islam West Africa Collection has been uploaded to Wikidata to make them to be more openly citable and accessible.",
    description: "<p>The <a href=\"https://islam.zmo.de/s/westafrica/page/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Islam West Africa Collection</em></a> (IWAC) boasts a significant number of bibliographical references. To align with the principles of open science and the WikiCite initiative, the metadata for these references has been uploaded to Wikidata. This effort makes the bibliographic data more discoverable, interoperable, and reusable by the global research community.</p><p>By integrating with Wikidata, the IWAC bibliographic data benefits from a structured, linked data environment. This not only enhances its visibility but also allows for complex queries and connections with other datasets, fostering new research possibilities. The skills involved in this project include data modeling for Wikidata, use of tools like OpenRefine for data cleaning and reconciliation, and understanding of linked data principles and metadata standards. The project also leverages platforms like Scholia to visualize and explore the scholarly contributions.</p>",
