		'The cross-regional workshop, organised by the Religion and Intellectual Culture unit, convened scholars from Indonesia, the United States, South Africa, the Netherlands, Senegal and Germany. The participants examined how concepts acquire normative force as reference points for communities, tools of governance and vehicles of translation across epistemic worlds. Rather than cataloguing terms, participants treated concepts as historically situated and politically charged, paying attention to their social significance, sites of production, and motives of use. One intervention called for “artful scholarship” that couples analytical rigour with storytelling, enabling knowledge to travel beyond the academy.\n\nCase studies across the papers traced concepts in motion under colonial legacies and contemporary power. Examples include the Ottoman millet being reworked into a Sunni-coded Turkish nation, “tolerance” in the UAE being used as a governance strategy to market harmony while depoliticising dissent, pesantren in Indonesia reframing tafaqquh fī al-dīn to align ethical formation with science and vocational training, and Old Tatar vocabulary being reshaped through cycles of re-Arabisation, Turkification and Russification, where transliteration “domesticates” meaning. Media and curation also proved to be central: Indonesian YouTube controversies illustrated a “visual rationality” that reduced local healing to mere trickery; museum collaborations around the Swahili word bahari (meaning both “ocean” and “knowledge”) modelled co-curation that went beyond object-centred displays; and exhibitions of Ottoman “colour-blindness” showed how selective memory circulates as civic virtue. Legal and ethical lenses provided further insight, with Deobandi jurists pragmatically reinterpreting dār al-islām and dār al-ḥarb under imperial rule. A concluding reflection juxtaposed baraka (blessing, growth) with the thermodynamic limits of fossil-fuelled economies.\n\nOver the course of two days, a clear message emerged: thinking with the Global South means making translation both an ethical and methodological process, and co-creating a shared, usable vocabulary for tracing how ideas evolve and spread.',
