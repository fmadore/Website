	abstract:
		'In this interview, Dr Frédérick Madore explains his involvement with the REMOBOKO project at ZMO and how it fits with his research on Islam and Muslim societies in francophone West Africa. He outlines his current project on Salafism and Pentecostalism on university campuses in Benin and Togo, exploring Christian-Muslim interactions, lived religion, its impact on secular academic environments, and the emergence of new religious elites. Madore also discusses the broader implications of this work for understanding contemporary religious trends and challenging simplistic narratives of radicalisation in the region.',
