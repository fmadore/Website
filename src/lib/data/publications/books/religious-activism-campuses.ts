	abstract: `Although religious organisations have coexisted with student unions at the Université de Lomé and the Université d'Abomey-Calavi since the 1970s, much of the literature has tended to focus on the role of student protests in triggering national conferences in Benin and Togo in the early 1990s, overlooking religion. Based on interviews with different generations of activists and the press in both countries, this book uncovers the neglected history of Christian and Muslim student associations on these campuses, originally strongholds of leftist, anti-imperialist and secular ideologies. It analyses the emergence of these associations under a one-party dictatorship in Togo and a Marxist-Leninist regime in Benin, and explores the implications of growing religiosity for these public universities as secular institutions.

The history of these associations reveals the campus as a microcosm reflecting wider national socio-political life, while also highlighting the importance of translocal factors in shaping the internal dynamics of these groups. Amidst the massification of university enrolments and rising graduate unemployment in recent decades, faith-based associations have come to offer more than religious guidance. Increasingly, they offer a "social curriculum", providing a space for socialisation and a set of skills, norms and moral values that complement the secular academic curriculum.`,

				"These nuances, however, do not detract from the book's contribution, which is considerable; this is due to its comprehensive analysis of the history and development of faith-based movements in Togo and Benin from 1970 to 2023. The book offers a valuable resource for scholars seeking to understand the complex interplay between faith, activism, and adaptation in Francophone Africa."

				'Madore has produced an important work that documents previously neglected histories and demonstrates the significance of faith-based associations in shaping student activism, religious dynamics, and elite formation in West Africa. The book will be valuable for scholars of religion and higher education in Africa, students of social movements and those interested in how religious identity intersects with political and economic change.'
