        <p>Great to be in Dakar for the 2025 Humanistica conference at the Universit√© Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar (UCAD).</p>
        
        <p>I'm looking forward to presenting my work on using artificial intelligence with the Islam West Africa Collection later this week.</p>
        
        <p>Even more so, I'm excited to be here to learn directly from scholars based on the continent about their innovative uses of digital humanities and AI in research, particularly concerning archives, cultural heritage, and African languages.</p>
