    abstract: "This masterclass will explore how computational approaches - from text mining and digital mapping to AI - are reshaping historical research. Through analysis of existing projects and collaborative hands-on exercises, we will examine key digital methodologies and critically assess both the potential and limitations of these tools. Particular attention will be paid to the application of digital approaches in non-Western contexts, especially African history, where unique challenges and opportunities arise.",
