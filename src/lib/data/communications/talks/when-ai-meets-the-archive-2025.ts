	abstract: 'The Islam West Africa Collection (IWAC) comprises over 14,000 documents spanning six countries and containing 25 million words. This corpus has become too vast for close reading. This talk will explore how large language models (LLMs) can transform such an unwieldy collection into more navigable resources through three practical applications: enhancing OCR accuracy and entity recognition for African materials; conducting experimental sentiment analysis across over 10,000 newspaper articles on the representation of Islam; developing conversational AI interfaces that transcend traditional keyword searching. Drawing on my experience, I will provide researchers with practical solutions for dealing with digital abundance while maintaining a critical awareness of the inherent limitations of AI.',
