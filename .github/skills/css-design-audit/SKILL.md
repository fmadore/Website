# CSS Design Audit Skill

This skill enables **intelligent design system auditing** that combines automated pattern detection with AI-powered reasoning to ensure CSS quality, consistency, and maintainability.

## Philosophy: Beyond Pattern Matching

This is NOT just a find-and-replace tool. You are a **design system consultant** who:

1. **Understands intent** - Why was this code written this way?
2. **Evaluates context** - Is a hardcoded value actually appropriate here?
3. **Reasons about semantics** - Is the right token being used for the right purpose?
4. **Considers architecture** - Should this pattern be extracted or consolidated?
5. **Thinks holistically** - How does this component fit the overall design language?

## When to Use This Skill

- **Component reviews**: Evaluate new or modified components for design quality
- **Design consistency audits**: Ensure visual coherence across similar components
- **Refactoring guidance**: Identify opportunities to consolidate patterns
- **Accessibility reviews**: Evaluate beyond checkbox compliance
- **Architecture decisions**: When to create utilities vs. component-scoped styles

## Audit Approach: Three-Layer Analysis

### Layer 1: Automated Detection (Quick Scan)

Run the automated script for initial pattern detection:

```bash
node .github/skills/css-design-audit/audit.mjs [path]
```

This catches obvious issues like:
- Hardcoded hex colors that match known tokens
- Pixel values on the 8-point grid
- Missing webkit prefixes
- Deprecated API usage

**Important**: Treat script output as a starting point, not the final answer.

### Layer 2: Contextual Reasoning (AI Analysis)

For each finding, apply intelligent reasoning:

#### Semantic Correctness
Ask: *"Is the RIGHT token being used for the RIGHT purpose?"*

| Scenario | Pattern Match Says | AI Should Reason |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Blue used for "Cancel" button | ✅ Uses `--color-primary` | ❌ Should be `--color-secondary` or neutral - primary implies main action |
| Teal badge for "Error" state | ✅ Uses `--color-accent` | ❌ Should be `--color-danger` - semantic mismatch |
| 18px spacing (not on grid) | ❌ Not a token | ✓ May be intentional for optical alignment - evaluate context |
| `#333` in SVG icon | ❌ Hardcoded color | ✓ May be correct if icon needs fixed color for brand consistency |

#### Contextual Exceptions
Recognize when hardcoded values are acceptable:

- **1px borders**: Don't suggest `var(--space-0.25)` - borders are intentionally thin
- **SVG/icon colors**: May need fixed values for brand assets
- **Third-party overrides**: Sometimes you must match external library colors
- **Optical adjustments**: Designers sometimes break the grid for visual balance
- **Animation keyframes**: May need specific percentage values
- **Aspect ratios**: Values like `16/9` are standards, not magic numbers

#### Questions to Ask
1. What is this component's **purpose**? (Action, display, navigation, feedback?)
2. What **state** is being styled? (Default, hover, active, error, success?)
3. Does the token choice **communicate the right meaning**?
4. Is there a **similar component** that handles this differently?
5. Would a user with **accessibility needs** be impacted?

### Layer 3: Architectural Evaluation (Design Patterns)

Look beyond individual values to assess overall quality:

#### Code Organization
- **Too many custom properties?** (>15 unique values suggests extraction needed)
- **Duplicate patterns?** Check if similar styles exist in other components
- **Missed utility classes?** Could existing utilities replace custom CSS?
- **Overly specific selectors?** Deep nesting indicates coupling problems

#### Pattern Consolidation
When you see repeated patterns across components:
```css
/* If you see this in 3+ components... */
.component-card {
  background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-surface) 80%, transparent);
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius-lg);
  /* ... similar properties ... */
}
```
**Recommendation**: Extract to a shared utility or extend existing patterns in `entity-cards.css`

#### Component Comparison
Before flagging issues, check how similar components handle the same concern:
- How do other cards handle hover states?
- What focus patterns do other interactive elements use?
- Is this spacing consistent with sibling components?

## Token Reference (For Context, Not Mechanical Replacement)

Use these to understand the design system's vocabulary, not as a lookup table:

### Semantic Colors (Choose by Meaning)
| Token | Meaning | Use For |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `--color-primary` | Main brand action | Primary CTAs, active nav, key links |
| `--color-secondary` | Supporting/neutral | Secondary buttons, metadata, less emphasis |
| `--color-accent` | Highlight/distinction | Badges, tags, special callouts |
| `--color-highlight` | Attention/importance | Warnings, featured items, notifications |
| `--color-success` | Positive outcome | Confirmations, valid states, achievements |
| `--color-danger` | Error/destructive | Errors, delete actions, critical warnings |

### Spacing Philosophy (8-Point Grid)
The grid exists for **visual rhythm**, not rigid compliance:
- `--space-1` to `--space-4`: Tight, internal spacing
- `--space-6` to `--space-8`: Standard component spacing  
- `--space-12` to `--space-24`: Section/layout spacing

**Judgment call**: If a value like `18px` appears, ask why—it might be optical adjustment or a mistake.

### Typography Purpose
- Sizes communicate **hierarchy**, not just appearance
- `--font-size-sm` = de-emphasized, metadata
- `--font-size-base` = body content
- `--font-size-lg`+ = headings, emphasis

## Accessibility: Beyond Checkboxes

Don't just check for presence of patterns—evaluate their effectiveness:

### Focus States
**Checkbox approach**: "Does it have `:focus-visible`?" ✓
**Intelligent approach**: 
- Is the focus indicator **visible enough** against the background?
- Does focus order make **logical sense**?
- Are focus styles **consistent** with similar interactive elements?

### Motion & Animation
**Checkbox approach**: "Does it check `prefers-reduced-motion`?" ✓
**Intelligent approach**:
- Is the animation **necessary** or purely decorative?
- Could this animation cause **vestibular issues**?
- Does the reduced-motion alternative still **convey the same information**?

### Color & Contrast
**Checkbox approach**: "Does it use semantic tokens?" ✓
**Intelligent approach**:
- Is there **sufficient contrast** for the specific context?
- Does the color choice work in **both light and dark modes**?
- Is color the **only** indicator, or is there redundant coding (icons, text)?

### Touch Targets
Don't just measure 44x44px—consider:
- Is there adequate **spacing between targets**?
- Do **hover states** have touch-friendly alternatives?
- Are **critical actions** easier to tap than destructive ones?

## Glassmorphism: Thoughtful Application

Glass effects are powerful but easily misused. Evaluate:

### When Glass Works
- Content overlaying complex backgrounds
- Elevated UI elements (modals, dropdowns)
- Creating depth hierarchy
- Light/dark mode transitions

### When Glass Fails
- Low-contrast text becomes unreadable
- Too many glass layers compete visually
- Performance on low-end devices
- Background provides insufficient blur contrast

### Required Pattern (When Appropriate)
```css
.glass-element {
  background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-surface) 80%, transparent);
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px); /* Safari - REQUIRED */
  border: 1px solid color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-border) 50%, transparent);
}
```

### Prefer Utility Classes
Check if existing utilities can be used instead of custom glass:
- `.glass-card`, `.glass-panel`, `.glass-button`
- `.glass-light`, `.glass-medium`, `.glass-heavy`

## Animation System Guidance

### CSS-Only Scroll Animations (Preferred)
```svelte
<section class="scroll-reveal">Fade up on scroll</section>
<div class="scroll-reveal-scale">Scale in on scroll</div>
<ul class="grid-stagger">Staggered children</ul>
```

### Deprecated JavaScript Approach
```svelte
<!-- DON'T USE - scrollAnimations.ts is deprecated -->
<div use:scrollAnimate={{ ... }}>
```

### Duration Semantics
| Token | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `--duration-instant` | Micro-interactions, toggles |
| `--duration-fast` | Hover states, small UI feedback |
| `--duration-normal` | Standard transitions |
| `--duration-slow` | Larger element movements |
| `--duration-slower` | Page transitions, complex animations |

## Media Query Validation

### Correct: PostCSS Custom Media
```css
@media (--sm) { }  /* 640px */
@media (--md) { }  /* 768px */
@media (--lg) { }  /* 1024px */
```

### Invalid: CSS Variables in Media Queries
```css
/* BROKEN - var() doesn't work in media queries */
@media (min-width: var(--breakpoint-md)) { }
```

## Audit Output Format

Structure your findings by severity and actionability:

### 🔴 Critical (Must Fix)
- Accessibility failures
- Broken functionality
- Semantic errors (wrong token for purpose)

### 🟡 Recommended (Should Fix)
- Hardcoded values with clear token equivalents
- Missing browser prefixes
- Inconsistent patterns vs. similar components

### 🔵 Suggestions (Consider)
- Opportunities for consolidation
- Minor optimizations
- Documentation gaps

### ✅ Positive Observations
- Well-implemented patterns worth noting
- Good accessibility practices
- Consistent design language

### Example Output
```
📋 CSS Design Audit: ComponentName.svelte
═══════════════════════════════════════════

🔴 CRITICAL

  Line 45: Semantic mismatch
  Using `--color-primary` for cancel button action
  → The blue color implies "primary action" but this is a dismissive action
  → Recommendation: Use `--color-secondary` or a neutral variant

🟡 RECOMMENDED

  Line 67: Missing Safari fallback
  `backdrop-filter: blur(12px);`
  → Add: `-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px);`

  Line 82: Hardcoded spacing
  `margin-bottom: 24px;`
  → This aligns with `--space-6` - recommend using token for maintainability

🔵 SUGGESTIONS

  Lines 45-78: Pattern duplication
  → This card styling closely matches `PublicationItem.svelte`
  → Consider extracting shared styles to `entity-cards.css`

✅ WELL DONE

  - Focus states properly implemented with `--focus-ring`
  - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
  - Consistent with sibling navigation components

Summary: 1 critical, 2 recommended, 1 suggestion
```

## Decision Framework

When unsure whether to flag an issue, ask:

1. **Impact**: Would fixing this improve UX, accessibility, or maintainability?
2. **Intent**: Did the developer likely make a conscious choice here?
3. **Consistency**: Does this deviate from established patterns without reason?
4. **Trade-offs**: Is there a valid reason for this approach?

**If you can't articulate why something should change, don't flag it.**
